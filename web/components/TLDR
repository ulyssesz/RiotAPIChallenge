TLDR
- Analyze ~100,000 matches
- Figure out what the best build for different roles per champion
- Determine what to build against ad/ap heavy teams


==Analyze ~100,000 matches
- Downloading
    - For every master and up player in EUW/NA, I searched for their most recent 15 games and selected the ones that were blind pick / rank on Summoner's Rift. 
    - Found 50,000 games each.

==Figure out what the best build for different roles per champion
- Determine role
    - Since the match data didn't have a clear role for every player, I decided to determine the role based on creep score and jungle creep score.
    - Since game length affects cs count, I normalized all the values by dividing each person's cs by his/her team's total cs.
    - Then I used K Means clustering to determine 3 categories, carries (solo lane + bot carry), jungler and support
    - This is the resulting graph [insert graph]
